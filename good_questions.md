@Sithis none exactly from leetcode but definitely variations of ones I had seen! Google loves tree and graph problems for sure. Onsite questions (not the actual questions because signed NDA but the types)-

    Graph problem involving nodes & bfs. The difficulty in this problem was how the input was given & knowing which data structures to use to manipulate the data so I could then implement the bfs.
    Tree traversal problem with nodes. Again, difficulty came from how the problem was given. Nodes had special properties that changed the complexity.
    Intervals type problem- a variation of interval scheduling problem.
    Generate all possibilities problem. The possibilities involved a lot of restrictions to them, so it was not as straight forward as say generate the power set problem.


Thank you!! I failed a lot of interviews before Google partly because I was still learning the interview process but also I just was not prepared enough.

    Everyday spend a few hours grinding through problems on leetcode (the first unsorted 100 are actually great for getting a taste of all types of problems). I also purchased the monthly premium subscription to get access to company-specific problems & mock interviews.
    Make sure to try to solve a problem on your own before looking at the leetcode solution or other people’s submissions. And after solving the problem once, try solving it at least 1-2 other ways (for ex if you solved it recursively first, try to figure out how to do it iteratively). Doing this trained me to think about problems in different ways which I think ultimately helped so much!
    If you’re a more visual & auditory learner like me, watch LOTS of youtube videos on problems & algorithms. My favorite channel by far is Back to Back SWE. He explains more than just the solution but how to think about breaking down the problem and approaching it.. I never truly understood recursion & backtracking until I watched his videos.
    Buy a whiteboard if you don’t have one and force yourself to write code! Writing code or typing it in Google docs with no editor really challenges how well you know a language.
    Practice interviews either through an online service (I used interviewing.io) or with another engineering friend & force yourself to say OUT LOUD what you're thinking. Conveying your thought process is key.
    Never give up! Never surrender!! (but forreal, keep going you GOT this! Best of luck.)
