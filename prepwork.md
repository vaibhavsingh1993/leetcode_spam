Here's my plan for my upcoming google interview (Started 2 months back, have around 2 more months till phone screen)-
Identified my weak sections a while back (dp, graphs)

    Practice weak topics on leetcode. Starting with easy and then medium. Slowly medium is becoming easier to solve (1.5 months spent, almost done).
    Get quality and timed practice on - https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/ . Much less questions for topics I already know but quality questions(1 month allotted).
    Practice more weak concepts identified in 2 and practice hard questions. Also revise basics of system design. Practice past google questions. (1 month)
    ---First phone screen---
    If qualified, practice more system design, advanced topics and hard questions.

It's a slow, painful process specially with work. It doesn't matter that you like problem solving and enjoy it. You just have to stick to the routine, not get demotivated (1-2 days are fine) and you slowly start seeing the changes.


You should be able to crack a decent amount of hard LCs, that being said, Google focuses pretty heavily on breadth.
So be sure to practice extensively on:

    backtracking(appears very often)
    dynamic programming
    graphs (dfs, bfs, union find [usually asked as a follow up question to optimize a purely dfs/bfs approach], dijkstra)
    two pointers (very often)
    binary search (very very often)

I've noticed somewhat of a new trend at Google, namely binary search on monotonic functions, i.e. : https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-largest-sum/.
Several others have mentioned getting interviews on this kind of problem, and you're pretty much gonna be able to come up with a solution instantly if you map it to binary search on sight.
